"""AuditLog model.

Per PROJECT_CONTRACT.md section 8: sensitive actions (trading mode
changes, strategy changes, risk changes, signal approval/rejection,
order placement, position closure, emergency stop) must be recorded
with who, what, when, before, and after. This phase defines the model
and writes to it from the auth flows it owns (e.g. login); later phases
write to it from their own sensitive actions.
